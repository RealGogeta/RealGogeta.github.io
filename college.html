        <img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/6819005752_4efddd3d06_z.jpg"/>
        <p>I'm interested in UC Davis because the school provides the Computer Science major. I'm interested in Computer Science because I would like to create video games and other computer programs. A good ACT score would be 25-31. As of now I do not have a ACT score so I will have to take the test and see in the future. The required SAT score for UC Davis is 1800. My PSAT score was 990 which means that I need to work on the test so I can have a higher score next time. The average GPA for UC Davis is a 4.0. I have a current GPA of 2.7 which means if I want to go to UC Davis, I'm going to need to learn how to manage my time and work so I can complete everything on time.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere in UC Davis allows you to do what you’re good at which is to be yourself. UC Davis has a Stadium which is called the Aggies Stadium. This should be the best place where you want to get pumped up and have electrifying experience. There is also the international center where you get to meet other people from other places.

As Berkeley is in a huge urban setting there is so much to do like going to Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive where you get to see beautiful art or the California Memorial Stadium where the football team plays and everyone is roaring.

          <p>The college life of UCLA is always moving and I would love to be part of this college setting. There are many clubs to join and events like the Bruin Bash. It’s an annual festival to kick off the school year.  Students and teachers are always doing research and discovering new things which is another thing I would love to experience of the UCLA college atmosphere.
