            <p>2A)    My computational innovation is VIVE VR. VIVE VR is a VR system that runs VR games on the user's PC. My artifact illustrates a player playing with the VR system and explains how VIVE VR uses computers to run the VR games. </p>
            <p>2C)	The innovation,VIVE VR, is a game system that plays VR games on PC. VIVE VR is beneficial because it is safer than other VR systems. It is safer since the system has a Chaperone System(1), which tells you if you are about to bump into a wall and allows you to continue playing with the VIVE VR system, with the feeling of being safe. Also the front facing camera allows the user to look around the "real world" so the user can get something to eat or talk to their friends(1). One possible harmful effect is that the user can experience cyber-sickness(2). Cyber-sickness is a physical side-effect that causes nausea, headaches, eye strain and neck strain(2). One possible impact to society is pain-management.This impacts society because VR has a palliative effect which allows cancer patients to feel less pain and the reduction of pain can boost survival rates(2).</p>
            <p>2D)	The innovation, VIVE VR, collects data of the user's position as a number. VIVE VR uses the distance the helmet is from the sensors as data. It does this by having the user place small hardware around user playroom or office(3). The VIVE VR system  processes the distance data to load in the specific location on the map that the player is in.The distance data is turned into the map data that the player can interact with in the game.This loads the radius of the map that the player can see so it takes less space on the computer.This allows the user to walk around their room and play with the VIVE VR system. One data storage concern is that the amount of computer ram needed to store the application data is so much that the average consumer can not afford it(4). It is concerning because it forces the average consumers to buy more outside products to make their VIVE VR system compatible with their computer.
